# scul.ai : Natural Language SQL Query Desktop App

This is a desktop application built with Next.js that allows users to query a PostgreSQL database using natural language. The application leverages the GROQ LLM API to access the LLaMA-3 model for converting natural language input into SQL queries, which are then executed against a PostgreSQL database. The stack used includes Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React, PostgreSQL, and Prisma for database management.
